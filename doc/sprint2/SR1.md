# Unfinished Tasks
- THEB-53 As a developer, I want to continue implementing the DAOs and associated object classes for the database.
- THEB-56 As a developer, I want to refactor the frontend to be more visually appealing.

# Practices
## Practices to Continue
- Allow everyone the opportunity to do some backend and some frontend instead of sticking to one aspect.
- Maintain good communication between team members through standups and meetings, as well as helping each other when we run into problems.
- Ensure that PRs are reviewed by at least one other person before being merged into the develop branch.

## New Practices to Try
- Have several people focus on completing one user story before beginning the next. This way, we can collaborate to finish critical tasks that may be blockers earlier rather than later.

## Practices to Stop
- Finish user stories throughout the sprint and merge them into develop when done instead of waiting until the last day to do pull requests.

# Best and Worst Experiences
## Best Experiences
- Being able to learn new technologies and applying them in an application.
- Creating something from scratch as a whole team.

## Worst Experiences
- The initial setup of the project and ensuring that the application worked on everyoneâ€™s local machines.
- Waiting until the last day to merge everything in and ensure that everything worked.
