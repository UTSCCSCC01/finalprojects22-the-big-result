# Unfinished Tasks
- All tasks were finished. However, it appears that some refactoring is necessary, as there are currently inefficiencies in the backend, especially regarding repeated database queries. 

# Practices
## Practices to Continue
- Allow everyone the opportunity to do some backend and some frontend instead of sticking to one aspect.
- Maintain good communication between team members through standups and meetings, as well as helping each other when we run into problems.
- Ensure that PRs are reviewed by at least one other person before being merged into the develop branch.
- Have several people focus on completing one user story before beginning the next. This way, we can collaborate to finish critical tasks that may be blockers earlier rather than later.

## New Practices to Try

-  Allow time for each person to help others with their area of speciality, instead of starting from scratch at every stage. E.g) If one person is really strong in the frontend, then it makes sense for them to volunteer some of their time to help others with the frontend.
- Estimate the scope of a single ticket, and don’t divide it up unnecessarily, as that can result in communication issues that wouldn’t happen if a single person worked on the task.

## Practices to Stop
- Leaving documentation to the last minute. This leads to a hectic schedule and can lead to missing vital information. 
- Calling functions from other people, without fully understanding it and talking to them beforehand. This may lead to confusion on how a certain part works. 

# Best and Worst Experiences
## Best Experiences
- Collaborating with other teammates and helping compensate for each others’ technical weaknesses.

## Worst Experiences
- Fixing merge conflicts at the last minute.
