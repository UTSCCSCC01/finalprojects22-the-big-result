## Competition

- TaskRabbit (https://www.taskrabbit.ca/ca/en/)
- Airtasker (https://www.airtasker.com/us/)
- UrbanCompany (https://www.urbancompany.com/)

## Similarities

TaskRabbit, Airtasker, and UrbanCompany deploy a model similar to Amorr wherein customers can browse through services and professionals
that are willing to provide specific services, view profiles and ratings, and book their desired professional.

## Differences

While TaskRabbit and Airtasker focus largely on handyman work such as moving, repairs, cleaning, and running errands with negligible 
beauty services traffic, Amorr focuses primarily on beauty services and other neglected services.
This is not the case with UrbanCompany which also focuses on beauty services; however, it along with Airtasker are not available in 
Canada as of May 2022.

### Who are the users and what are the scenarios that Amorr is better for?

Since Amorr focuses on beauty services, it caters to users who want to have beauty services provided to them from the comfort of
their home without having to worry about scheduling, transportation, quality of service, and payment. These services include but
are not limited to hairdressing, haircuts, makeup, and eyebrow threading.
On the other hand, it enables beauty professionals to offer their services and receive payment seamlessly while increasing their 
revenue by reaching customers who were previously obstructed.

### Why didn't the competitors focus on beauty services and what would it take from them to do so?

It is likely that the competitors simply overlooked the beauty services industry. There is a large and growing demand for these
services which Amorr captures. While incorporating beauty services may not be difficult for the competitors from a technological
standpoint, it would most definitely clutter their products as they try to focus on several large and dissimilar industries. Overall,
it would be challenging for them to appeal to a new customer base and retain their current customers without adding complexity
to their product.

## Additional

We should note that products such as Upwork (https://www.upwork.com/) and Fiverr (https://fiverr.com/) deploy a similar model to Amorr
where customers can browse different services and professionals and purchase the services they desire; however, they focus on fields 
such as graphics and design, development and IT, sales and marketing, animation and editing, and writing.
