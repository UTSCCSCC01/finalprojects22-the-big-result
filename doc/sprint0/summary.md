# Summary
## Project Objective
Our goal is to create a web interface where users can easily securely connect with beauty professionals nearby them and get on demand services at their doorstep. This secure user-friendly platform will eliminate commuting issues for users, help them choose their service preference, track their service real-time, and review their experience. The web app will also help businesses expand their reach by supporting a new way of service delivery.

## Key Personas
- **Martha Williams**: A 24-year-old cosmetology graduate who has recently started her own hairstyling business.
- **Jonathon Amble:** A 45-year-old retired construction worker and stay-at-home parent who lives Scarborough and has been in a wheelchair for 5 years because of paralyzed legs. 

## Key Scenarios
- Martha is looking for ways to promote her new business. She knows that having a good online presence is important for a business, but she doesn't have the coding or design experience to build her own website. She is looking for some way to extend her reach online in a way that requires minimal setup on her end.
- Jonathon wants to go to a barbershop rather than cutting his own hair for his brother’s wedding. Since his favorite barbershop isn’t wheelchair friendly, he wants a home-delivered hair-cut service. He wants a to book a high-reviewed professional service with ease as he is an amateur with the Internet. 

## Key Principles
- **Satisfaction for all types of users:** When designing the product, we want to ensure that our decisions provide quality features for both the customers and the professionals without sacrificing one for the other. This means that we will do our best to make sure that both sides of the application have an equal amount of effort put into them so that our product can benefit both parties equally.
- **User friendliness:** The application should be simple to use rather than convoluted. We will value the ease of use for our users over the convenience of development in order to ensure that we provide a quality product as a final result.
