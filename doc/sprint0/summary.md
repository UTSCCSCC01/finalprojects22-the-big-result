# Summary
## Project Objective
Our goal is to create a web interface where users can easily securely connect with beauty professionals nearby them and get on demand services at their doorstep. This secure user-friendly platform will eliminate commuting issues for users, help them choose their service preference, track their service real-time, and review their experience. The web app will also help businesses expand their reach by supporting a new way of service delivery.

## Key Personas
- **Walter Grey:** A 55 year-old senior developer who is actively job-seeking for a new position. Because of the nature of his remote job, he has grown pandemic hair because of all nearby ones being closed for lockdown. 
- **Adriana Peterson:** is a 21 year-old cosmetology student who has a passion to get her makeup done by professionals. She is planning on studying cosmetology at St Lawrence College and she preferably wants to still have her favorite beauty services close to her while studying. 
- **Beatrice Rose:** A 25 year-old a recent graduate of the University of Toronto who has followed her dreams and opened a small beauty business *Bee Pretty*. 

## Key Scenarios
- Walter wishes to get a last minute haircut for his upcoming in-person job interview, but was unable to book at any of the hair salons near where he lives. He hopes to be able to get a haircut before this interview, and ideally without needing to go to lengths to commute to a far away salon.
- Adriana is looking to explore new beauty services in her area, but doesnâ€™t quite know where to start. She is more interested in meeting specific professionals who are rated highly rather than finding one specific location to frequent, and a part of her wishes there were some way for her to also get services from the professionals in her old area without the need for her to commute long distances herself.
- Beatrice's new beauty business is still relatively small and is feeling the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic very strongly. She is looking for new and innovative ways to expand her business and seek out new customers.

## Key Principles
- **Satisfaction for all types of users:** When designing the product, we want to ensure that our decisions provide quality features for both the customers and the professionals without sacrificing one for the other. This means that we will do our best to make sure that both sides of the application have an equal amount of effort put into them so that our product can benefit both parties equally.
- **User friendliness:** The application should be simple to use rather than convoluted. We will value the ease of use for our users over the convenience of development in order to ensure that we provide a quality product as a final result.
