## Team organization and role division
Team roles and tasks were assigned in the first meeting at the beginning of the sprint, as well as the team contract. This was done based on interest and skills, keeping in mind similar workloads.

For sprint 0, the responsibilities were distributed as follows:
Team contract - All
Summary - Ava, Amy
Competition - Vishal
Personas - Fariha, Ananya
Product Backlog - Together
Setup - Carlos
Documentation README - Carlos
User Experience/ UI - Vishal, Amy
Done - Ananya
Process - Noor, Ava

These roles assign responsibility, but are not restrictive. Team members are expected to look over the project, and are pulled into the parts that need more work if they are done. 

### Tools
- **Figma** to create prototypes for the user interface design
- **Google docs** to collaboratively work on sprint 0 documents. Everyone is able to read and suggest changes if necessary.
- **Frontend tools: NPM**, used to install the necessary JS packages. Used in conjunction with ReactJS as the frontend framework.
- **Backend tools: Pip**, used to install the necessary python packages. Used in conjunction with Flask for the backend server framework. 
- **Microsoft Azure: SQL**, used as the remote database for this project. To connect to it, we used ODBC as the database driver. 

## Decision making
Minor decisions are discussed in the group chat, using the thread feature in Discord. We want to make sure we frequently give and receive feedback to the team through discord to reduce major last minute adjustments/decisions. Discussions that cannot be done over the chat are discussed during team meetings, hopefully reaching a consensus. Depending on the nature of the decision, more information may be needed, such as contacting the product owner/TA/Professor. 

If a consensus cannot be reached through a verbal discussion, the topic is moved to the next meeting, or after an hour break if the decision is time sensitive. After everyone’s had time to think about the issue, if a consensus still cannot be reached, a vote is taken. 

## Prioritizing user stories
The team discusses their understanding of what a minimum viable product is with the product owners. User stories that interact with features directly with the minimum viable product are prioritized. The rest of the user stories deal with extra satisfier features. Those of similar priority can be prioritized based on the extent of the benefit they bring to the final product and the amount of effort, time, it takes to implement the and the complexity that they bring. 

### Point estimation
If there is a conflict, we can go through 2 rounds of voting to reach an agreement and have a majority vote out of 7 people without ties. We may use Scrum poker to assign points to user stories.

## Meetings
Team meetings happen in-person every Monday after lecture, as well as online using Discord when the need arises. At this point, only a few meetings have been needed, but we expect 3 standup meetings a week during the busier sprints to address any issues. 

Tentative dates for these meetings are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, with lengths of 1 hour. Whenever someone has an issue they wish to raise in a meeting, they will drop it in the discord chat, and it will be pinned as a topic for the next meeting. This is an agreement that was reached after our first meeting lasted over two hours, to prioritize vital information. Less important discussions happen informally over the team chat. 

## Next phase
- Reviewing documents/designs/prototypes by multiple team members before submission helped clear up confusions/blockers. Similarly in the future sprints code reviews will also be done by at least one other member.
- Keep frequently providing and receiving feedback in chat and meetings to avoid major disruption/adjustment requirements
- Have the mindset of achieving the minimum requirements (“good enough”) before moving towards “great”. 
- Meetings were more efficient when a team member led the meeting
