## Release goals

The goal of the release is to create a web interface where users can easily and securely connect with service providers near them and get on-demand services such as beauty, hair, and landscaping, at their doorstep. This user-friendly platform will eliminate commuting issues for users, help them choose their service preference, track their service in real-time, and review their experience. The web app will also help businesses expand their reach by supporting a new way of service delivery.

## Scope:

To determine the scope of the project, we met with Kritika, the product owner to refine the user stories and determine the key features that should be available at the end of the project. In addition, she prioritized the user stories by dividing them into 4 broad priorities based on expected ROI: extremely high priority, high priority, medium priority, and low priority. 

The goal for sprint1 is to create the first version of the system architecture, define and work towards the minimum viable product as defined by Kritika, the product owner.
