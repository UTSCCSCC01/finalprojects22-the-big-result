# Unfinished Tasks
- Caching several of the views and the DAO functions.
- Continue refactoring the frontend to fix small bugs or improve the workflow

# Practices
## Practices to Continue
- Allow everyone the opportunity to do some backend and some frontend instead of sticking to one aspect.
- Maintain good communication between team members through standups and meetings, as well as helping each other when we run into problems.
- Ensure that PRs are reviewed by at least one other person before being merged into the develop branch.
- Have several people focus on completing one user story before beginning the next. This way, we can collaborate to finish critical tasks that may be blockers earlier rather than later.

## New Practices to Try
- Prepare before a meeting for the stuff you need to bring up and talk about. This way we maximize the effectiveness of meetings.
- Broadly explain what you’re doing and how you’re doing it, especially for tasks that might impact/relate to other people’s tasks. Do this quickly during standup and meetings.

## Practices to Stop
- Disconnectedness of understanding other people’s work. We need to better communicate who is working on what and how they’re going to implement it.
- Try to complete more tasks throughout the sprint rather than the last few days.

# Best and Worst Experiences
## Best Experiences
- Collaborating with other teammates and helping each other learn.
- Working on a full stack feature

## Worst Experiences
- Getting used to new technology can be challenging.
- Interdependencies between user stories: not every part of the project can be broken to stories that are entirely independent, so trying to bring two user stories’ implementations and assumptions together can be difficult.
